I am a research scientist at Amazon. During my Ph.D., I was lucky to work with Prof. [Sarath Chandar](http://sarathchandar.in/) at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/person/abdelrahman-zayed/) on understanding why language models take discriminatory decisions based on gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion. I also worked on developing methods to mitigate and measure these biases. In general, my research interests include natural language processing, fairness, and responsible AI.
