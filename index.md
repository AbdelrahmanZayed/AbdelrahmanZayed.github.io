I am a Ph.D. candidate at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/en/person/abdelrahman-zayed/) working with Prof. [Sarath Chandar](http://sarathchandar.in/). My research interests include natural language processing and fairness. More specifically, I am interested in understanding why language models can be biased against certain groups based on their gender, race, sexual orientation, or religion. I also work on developing new methods to mitigate these biases. If you wanna chat, feel free to email me at `abdel.mylastname.1@gmail.com`
