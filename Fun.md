I started learning piano when I was a kid, but I stopped when I got busy with the university. One positive impact of COVID-19 was that it made me start playing again. At Mila, we have our Mila Got Talent show in December, which I participated in twice:

I played 'My Heart Will Go On' by Celine Dion in 2021 when the show was online: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qAO4XGsoHRJ6J7iyfh8owQkvXP2dk2p1/view?usp=sharing">[video]</a></dt>
I played 'Alla Turca' by Mozart in 2022 when the show was in person:


<be> I also play kickboxing, although I am still not very good at it and I get punched in the face in almost every fight! Recently, randomly bumped into someone in the metro holding a cello, which made me curious to ask her where to learn. I got to know that she just finished her PhD in music and now teaches cello, and eventually started taking classes with her (highly recommend). I also love reading! For me, spending time reading is as exciting as spending time with one of my close friends!
