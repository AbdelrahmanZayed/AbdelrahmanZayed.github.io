<dt>Music</dt>: I started learning piano, but I stopped when I got busy with the university. One positive impact of COVID-19 was that it made me start playing again. At Mila, we have our Mila Got Talent show in December, which I participated in twice:

I played <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qAO4XGsoHRJ6J7iyfh8owQkvXP2dk2p1/view?usp=sharing">['My Heart Will Go On']</a></dt> by Celine Dion in 2021 when the show was online, and <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Kqf-kE5VoTM-59JaC0gZvcaF9gjIzFaJ/view?usp=sharing">['Alla Turca']</a></dt> (the video taken by my beautiful friend Motahareh Sohrabi) by Mozart in 2022 when the show became in-person again.

Recently, randomly bumped into someone in the metro holding a cello, which made me curious to ask her where to learn. I got to know that she just finished her PhD in music and now teaches cello, and eventually started taking classes with her (her name is Jessica Korotk and I highly recommend her). 



<dt>Sports</dt>: I play kickboxing, although I am still not very good at it and I get punched in the face in almost every fight!
  
 <dt>Others</dt>: I also love reading! For me, spending time reading is as exciting as spending time with one of my close friends!
