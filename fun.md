I started learning piano when I was a kid and then stopped a very long time ago. Having a lot of free time during COVID encouraged me to start playing again. I participated in the Mila Talent Show (yes, we have a talent show at Mila!) in 2021 where I  played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f0SORftQxV0">My Heart Will Go On</a> by Celine Dion; and in 2022 where I played <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=02FrsWDILlk">Alla Turca</a> by Mozart (the video was taken by my beautiful friend Motahareh Sohrabi).

More recently, I randomly bumped into someone in the metro carrying a cello, which made me curious to ask her where to learn. I got to know that she had just finished her Ph.D. in music and now teaches cello, and she eventually became my cello teacher (her name is Jessica Korotkin, highly recommended).

I play kickboxing, although I am still not very good at it, and I get punched in the face in almost every fight! I also love reading! Spending time reading is as exciting as spending time with one of my close friends!
