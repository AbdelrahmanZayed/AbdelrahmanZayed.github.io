I love teaching!! My first experience in teaching was in 2016 when I was one of the teaching assistants for the analog communications course with Prof. Ragia I. Badr and Prof. Samy S. Soliman at Cairo University. During my Ph.D., I taught machine learning with my supervisor, Prof. Sarath Chandar, in <a href="https://sarathchandar.in/teaching/ml/fall2020/">Fall 2020</a> and <a href="https://chandar-lab.github.io/INF8245E/2021/">Fall 2021</a> at Polytechnique Montreal.
