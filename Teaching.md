I love teaching!! My first experience in teaching was in Fall 2016, when I was one of the teaching assisstants for the analog communications course with Prof. Ragia I. Badr and Prof. Samy S. Soliman at Cairo University. During my Ph.D., I taught Applied machine learning with my supervisor, Prof. Sarath Chandar, in <a href="https://sarathchandar.in/teaching/ml/fall2020/">Fall 2020</a> and <a href="https://chandar-lab.github.io/INF8245E/2021/">Fall 2021</a> at Polytechnique Montreal. Currently, I am preparing a new course about fairness in language models, which I plan to (informaly) teach both online and at Mila in Fall 2024.
